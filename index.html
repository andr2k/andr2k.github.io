<p>Hi from the conference! Thank you for scanning the code :)</p>
<p>Let me introduce myself. I position myself as a Software Develper now, but I also have entrepreneurial spirit, so possibly my current job search is a step to a successful personal project in future. </p>
<p>For last 10+ years, I've been busy with several projects, one of which was a great success at its time, and the others were good source of experience for me. After two years of studies and traveling, I am coming back to my career. I am here to make some friends, find inspiration, move closer to modern trends.</p>
<p>Some of my experience is mentioned in my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/adskc8omw35i8fi/Andriy%20Kravchenko-public.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>
<p>Would you like to get in touch?</p>
