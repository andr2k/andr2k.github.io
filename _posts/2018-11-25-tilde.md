JavaScript is one of the most popular languages in the world. Despite its relative ease of learning, it has some operators which may be hard for understanding. One of such operators is `~` (tilde) which means BITWISE NOT in terms of Boolean algebra.

How Does It Work?

The BITWISE NOT operator performs the NOT operation on each bit.

| Base 10   | Base 2                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 12        | 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ~12 = -13 | 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110011 |
